            <p>Do you want a jelly baby? Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime. This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my TARDIS… Oh my word! Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Would you like a jelly baby? Goodbye... Fancypants! I don't like it. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Who am I? WHO…AM…I?! Well, it wouldn't be cricket. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. It seems you have a very large rat Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat? What?! Come out. And don't touch anything! But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true?</p>

The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.</p>
