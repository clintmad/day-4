This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. Life depends on change and renewal. My ship…my TARDIS… Oh my word! Dreams are important…never underestimate them. I am the Doctor! The original, you might say! Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Would you like a jelly baby? Goodbye... Fancypants! I don't like it. Courage isn’t a matter of not being frightened, it’s being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.</p>

            <p>Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. Like Alice, I try to believe three impossible things before breakfast. Who am I? WHO…AM…I?! Well, it wouldn't be cricket. Death is always more frightening when it strikes invisibly. It seems you have a very large rat Brigadier—maybe you should employ the services of a very large cat? What?! Come out. And don't touch anything! But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true?</p>

            <h1>But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor.</h1>
            <p>You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true? I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. I think you need a doctor. Yes? What is it? What do you want? Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery, what about you? A straight line may be the shortest distance between two points, but it is by no means the most interesting. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. The waves of time wash us all clean. People who talk about infallibility are usually on very shaky ground.</p>
